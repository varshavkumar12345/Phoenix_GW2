      "✅ Label: SUPPORTS\n",
      "🧠 Mistral Score: 80\n",
      "✍️ Reason: The claim is straightforward and does not contain obvious exaggerations or falsehoods. Nikolaj Coster-Waldau has indeed worked with various production companies, and it is plausible that he has worked with Fox Broadcasting Company. However, without specific details or verification, the claim is moderately credible.\n",

      "✅ Label: SUPPORTS\n",
      "🧠 Mistral Score: 95\n",
      "✍️ Reason: The statement \"Roman Atwood is a content creator\" is a factual claim that can be easily verified. Roman Atwood is a well-known YouTuber and content creator, so the statement is credible. There are no misleading, exaggerated, or false claims present, and no patterns typical of misinformation are detected.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔍 Checking claim #3: History of art includes architecture, dance, sculpture, music, painting, poetry literature, theatre, narrative, film, photography and graphic arts.\n",
      "✅ Label: SUPPORTS\n",
      "🧠 Mistral Score: 95\n",
      "✍️ Reason: The text is a straightforward list of various forms of art, which is accurate and widely accepted. There are no misleading, exaggerated, or false claims present. The information is factual and aligns with standard definitions of art forms.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔍 Checking claim #4: Adrienne Bailon is an accountant.\n",
      "✅ Label: REFUTES\n",
      "🧠 Mistral Score: 0\n",
      "✍️ Reason: Adrienne Bailon is a well-known actress, singer, and television personality, not an accountant. The claim is false.\n",

      "🔍 Checking claim #5: System of a Down briefly disbanded in limbo.\n",
      "✅ Label: NOT ENOUGH INFO\n",
      "🧠 Mistral Score: 30\n",
      "✍️ Reason: The statement \"System of a Down briefly disbanded in limbo\" is vague and lacks specific details, which is a common pattern in misinformation. Without additional context or reliable sources, it's difficult to verify the claim. The use of the term \"limbo\" is also ambiguous and does not provide clear information about the band's status.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔍 Checking claim #6: Homeland is an American television spy thriller based on the Israeli television series Prisoners of War.\n",
      "✅ Label: SUPPORTS\n",
      "🧠 Mistral Score: 95\n",
      "✍️ Reason: The statement accurately reflects the factual origin of the American television series \"Homeland,\" which is indeed based on the Israeli series \"Prisoners of War.\" There are no misleading, exaggerated, or false claims present.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔍 Checking claim #7: Beautiful reached number two on the Billboard Hot 100 in 2003.\n",
      "✅ Label: NOT ENOUGH INFO\n",
      "🧠 Mistral Score: 0\n",
      "✍️ Reason: The song \"Beautiful\" by Christina Aguilera did not reach number two on the Billboard Hot 100 in 2003. It peaked at number 19.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔍 Checking claim #8: Neal Schon was named in 1954.\n",
      "✅ Label: NOT ENOUGH INFO\n",
      "🧠 Mistral Score: 10\n",
      "✍️ Reason: The statement \"Neal Schon was named in 1954\" is factually incorrect. Neal Schon, the famous guitarist, was born in 1954, not named in that year. This is a clear example of misinformation.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔍 Checking claim #9: The Boston Celtics play their home games at TD Garden.\n",
      "✅ Label: SUPPORTS\n",
      "🧠 Mistral Score: 100\n",
      "✍️ Reason: The statement is a well-known fact that can be easily verified through reliable sources. The Boston Celtics have played their home games at TD Garden since 1995.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔍 Checking claim #10: The Ten Commandments is an epic film.\n",
      "✅ Label: SUPPORTS\n",
      "🧠 Mistral Score: 70\n",
      "✍️ Reason: The statement is factually correct but lacks context. \"The Ten Commandments\" is indeed an epic film, but without additional context, it's difficult to assess the full credibility of the claim. The term \"epic\" is subjective and can be applied to various films, making the statement somewhat vague.\n",
